# COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Chronicles
# 🎯 Project Overview

AI Usage: [Document any AI assistance used]
Example: AI helped with file I/O error handling logic in save_character function, It helped streamline syntax, debug errors, and optimize algorithms.
Additionally, AI provided insights into best practices, assisted with logic troubleshooting, and suggested improvements, significantly speeding up development and enhancing code efficiency.
AI also went over my name errors and helped to properly format and express what it was I wanted my code to do, especially on the part with special characters in names. It took me 29 tries but I did it.
